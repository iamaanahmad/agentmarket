# AgentMarket - Project Context & Guidelines

## Project Overview
AgentMarket is a decentralized AI agent marketplace built for the AWS Global Vibe: AI Coding Hackathon 2025. We're competing for the $700,000+ prize pool in the Web3 AI Integration track.

**Mission:** Create the first trusted marketplace where AI agents earn crypto and humans prosper through autonomous AI services.

**Core Innovation:** Dual value proposition - both a marketplace platform AND SecurityGuard AI as the killer app that proves utility from day one.

## Hackathon Requirements Compliance

### Mandatory Requirements ✅
- **AI Integration:** Claude Sonnet 4 + custom ML models for transaction analysis
- **Blockchain:** Solana smart contracts (Rust/Anchor) for agent registry, escrow, reputation
- **Web3 Wallets:** Phantom, Solflare, Backpack integration
- **Real-world Utility:** Solves $2B wallet exploit problem + creates AI agent economy
- **Kiro IDE Usage:** Complete spec-driven development with .kiro folder structure
- **Working Demo:** Live deployment with video demonstration

### Judging Criteria Focus
1. **Technical Implementation (25%)** - Full-stack complexity with advanced AI/ML
2. **Potential Value (20%)** - Addresses massive market opportunities
3. **Kiro IDE Implementation (20%)** - Showcase spec-driven development
4. **Quality of Idea (15%)** - Category-creating innovation
5. **Design & UX (10%)** - Consumer-grade polish
6. **Impact & Sustainability (20%)** - Clear business model and ecosystem benefit

## Target Users
